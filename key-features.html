					You're tracked by Google, by your ISP, your government and hundreds of data collectors while in incognito or other private browsing modes. Your browsing history is easily
					accessible (via your DNS cache) upon incognito window close.
				</p>
				<p>
					Behind a VPN, your real IP address can leak through certain types of WebRTC calls -- only Epic blocks them. Even if your IP address is hidden, tens of thousands of websites use
					fingerprinting techniques such as accessing image canvas data to track you.
				</p>
				<p>
					Epic blocks fingerprinting scripts and functions like image canvas data access to protect you which no browser extension can do. There is no combination of settings changes and
					browser add-ons which provides the same level of protection, let alone the ease and speed of use that Epic does. Unfortunately, any browser add-on has access to your entire
					browsing and search history and while many may protect you from some trackers, they often collect and sell your data to others -- so browser add-ons may reduce your privacy and
					security rather than enhance it.
				</p>
				<p>
					Epic is a private browser that's fast, simple and actually works. When you're using Epic with our encrypted proxy on, your data is encrypted and hidden from the government, from
					your ISP, from Google, from your employer, and from hundreds of data collectors. On close of Epic, there's no easily accessible record of your browsing history left on your
					computer. We believe what you browse & search should always be private.

				<p>
					Over 80% of websites use one or more tracking tools. We've found an average of six per website with that number rising to a dozen or more on larger websites. New FCC regulations
					allow ISPs such as Verizon, Comcast and all others to both save and sell your browsing history.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the $100+ billion dollar advertising industry, even a one percent additional yield means an extra billion dollars a year in revenues for advertisers hence the massive incentive
					to track you and show you more personal and creepy ads (unless you're using Epic).
				</p>
				<p>
					Spy on the spies in Epic. Epic shows you who's tracking you in your other browsers (most likely dozens of data collectors) as well as the trackers Epic blocks at each webpage you
					visit.
				</p>
				<p>
					Epic protects you from over one thousand tracking attempts in a typical browsing session. Over a year of browsing it works out to hundreds of thousands of bits of data about you
					that Epic protects.
