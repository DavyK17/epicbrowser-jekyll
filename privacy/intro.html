        		<h4>Always-On Private Browsing</h4>
        		<p>The most comprehensive local private browsing in any browser. Always-On because we don't believe in a private browsing "mode". All your browsing should be private.</p>

        		<h4>One-Click Encrypted Proxy</h4>
        		<p> Click the red open socket icon to turn on Epic's built-in encrypted proxy. This hides your
                IP address (with a U.S -based IP) and encrypts all your data when you want to be very private.</p>

        		<h4>Trackers & Third-party Cookies Blocked</h4>
        		<p>Trackers are companies that track where and what you browse on the internet. They may associate your online data with offline data and sell your data and or use it to show you targeted ads.  Epic is the only browser that actively blocks thousands of trackers.</p>

        		<p style="width: 275px;">Use the download arrow button at the top right of Epic to download videos and audio from hundreds of websites including YouTube, Vimeo, Soundcloud, Facebook and many others.  For some sites such as YouTube, Epic creates a download button in the webpage itself.</p>

        		<p>Epic protects your searches from being saved and tracked. Epic automatically loads search engines via its built-in proxy because search engines track you by your IP address.</p>

				received is encrypted.</p>
