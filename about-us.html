        <p><strong>The Epic Privacy Browser is the first web browser built on Chromium (like Google's Chrome browser) engineered to protect your privacy</strong>. Epic is in always-on "private browsing mode", so on close of Epic all browsing data is deleted (while you're browsing, as little as possible is stored).</p>
        <p>Epic has removed all Google tracking and blocks hundreds of other companies from tracking you. If you turn on Epic's encrypted proxy, you have protection from snooping by hackers, trackers, your ISP, government, and employer as well.</p>

        <h3 class="font-weight-bold mb-3">We believe what you search and browse online should always be private by design. No web services so data collection is impossible.</h3>
        <p>We believe that you should not have to trust us with your data; rather, we should not have access to your data to the maximum extent possible. For this reason, Epic does not use any web services.</p>
        <p>Autofill in the Epic Privacy Browser is done via a local database, so Epic never sends what you type in the address bar to any server. Epic never records your history (except for tab forward/back) so that after a tab is closed, there is no record on your system of having visited that particular web page (to log you in, the site may have stored cookies, which are deleted upon closing Epic).</p>
        <p>Epic's proxy does not log anything. Though it is not private-by-design unlike the TOR network, we continue to use our encrypted proxy instead because it's much faster and more secure (2&ndash;3% of TOR's exit nodes have been found to be malicious).</p>

    <div class="content-box">
        <h3 class="font-weight-bold mb-3">Just works.</h3>
        <p>Epic should "just work" as a normal, fast, daily-use web browser. This principle is very difficult in practice to achieve for a true and thoroughly private browser like Epic because of how prevalent online tracking is.</p>
        <p>We strongly recommend all users enable both AdBlock and Epic's encrypted proxy. With both active, there will be an occasional website that doesn't load. In such cases, it's relatively fast to disable AdBlock for that site and to potentially disable the proxy as well.</p>
        <p>There will still be a few sites that don't work because of some of Epic's core privacy measures, such as blocking fingerprinting. We're working on similar, easy ways to disable our privacy measures for just those sites so that virtually every website will work in Epic just as easily as in any other browser.</p>

    <div class="content-box">
        <h3 class="font-weight-bold mb-3">Privacy is essential to freedom.</h3>
        <p>Without privacy, we don't have freedom. If you know the government, your ISP and hundreds of other companies are watching what websites you visit, who you communicate with, and what search queries you make, you're effectively under surveillance and your behavior changes. You'll begin to censor yourself, effectively building a kind of "jail" in your mind of what is and isn't "acceptable".</p>
        <p>The internet is the most open form of media that has ever existed and connects billions of people in free and open communication, and information and knowledge sharing. Privacy is essential to online freedom. We believe a free and open internet is worth preserving.</p>

        <h3 class="font-weight-bold mb-3">One of only three companies in the world to have earned your trust.</h3>
        <p>When Google insisted on tracking our users, we resolutely said <strong>NO</strong>, even though Google then cut off our revenues. We're run lean and we will not compromise our promise to you, our transparency, nor your privacy. We thank the millions of users of Epic for your support!</p>
