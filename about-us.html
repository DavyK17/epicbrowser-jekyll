        <p><strong>The Epic Privacy Browser was the first web browser built on Chromium (like Google's Chrome browser) engineered to protect your privacy</strong>.</p>
        <p>Epic has removed all Google tracking and blocks hundreds of companies from tracking you with extensive anti-fingerprinting protection and the Epic ad blocker. If you turn on Epic's encrypted proxy, you have protection from snooping by hackers, trackers, your ISP, government, and employer as well.</p>

        <h3 class="font-weight-bold mb-3">We believe what you search and browse online should always be private by design.</h3>
        <p>We believe that you should not have to trust us with your data; rather, we should not have access to your data to the maximum extent possible.  So for example, autofill in the Epic Privacy Browser is done via a local database, so Epic never sends what you type in the address bar to any server.</p>
        <p>Epic's encrypted proxy does not log any browsing data.  Though it is not private-by-design like the TOR network, we continue to use our encrypted proxy instead because it's much faster and more secure (2&ndash;3% of TOR's exit nodes have been found to be malicious).</p>

    <div class="content-box">
        <h3 class="font-weight-bold mb-3">Just works.</h3>
        <p>Epic should "just work" as a normal, fast, daily-use web browser. This principle guides us to make Epic's privacy features comprehensive but such that they don't break the functionality of most sites.</p>
        <p>We strongly recommend all users enable both Epic's ad blocker and encrypted proxy for maximum privacy.  There will be a few sites that don't work because of some of Epic's core privacy measures e.g more and more sites are blocking access via a VPN or proxy.  In those cases, you can use Epic's Umbrella button to disable some of Epic's protections for only those sites so they can load.</p>

    <div class="content-box">
        <h3 class="font-weight-bold mb-3">Privacy is essential to freedom.</h3>
        <p>Without privacy, we don't have freedom. If you know the government, your ISP and hundreds of other companies are watching what websites you visit, who you communicate with, and what search queries you make, you're effectively under surveillance and your behavior changes. You'll begin to censor yourself, effectively building a kind of "jail" in your mind of what is and isn't "acceptable".</p>
        <p>The internet is the most open form of media that has ever existed and connects billions of people in free and open communication, and information and knowledge sharing. Privacy is essential to online freedom. We believe a free and open internet is worth preserving.</p>

        <h3 class="font-weight-bold mb-3">One of only three companies in the world to have earned your trust.</h3>
        <p>When Google insisted on tracking our users, we resolutely said <strong>NO</strong>, even though Google then cut off our revenues. We're run lean and we will not compromise our promise to you, our transparency, nor your privacy.</p>
